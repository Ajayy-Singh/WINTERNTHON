## 👥 Team & Hackathon Details

- **Team Name:** Bug_Slayers  
- **Hackathon:** Winternthon  
- **Problem Statement:** WIN12 – Write from your heart

In the bustling lanes of Hyderabad's old city near Charminar, a passionate group of educators and mentors were determined to help students write with focus and honesty — whether for Telugu essays, English answers, or long responses in competitive exams.
Suhani Pal, the gentle yet firm language teacher, often shared her concern:
"So many students lose their own voice because they get distracted or rush through copying. They need a calm place to truly think and write."
Tamada Ramya, the dedicated project guide, added:
"And when they do write, we should save everything safely — the words, the session, so they can come back to their own thoughts later."
Sayan Deb, the encouraging mentor with a tech spark, nodded:
"Simple storage, linked to each student. No fancy stuff yet — just reliable saving and easy access."
Bollena Varsh, the warm and practical one in the group, smiled while stirring her Irani chai:
"Let's make it feel like home — peaceful, like sitting in a quiet Telangana room with a wooden table and the faint smell of biryani from next door."
One warm January evening in 2026, over steaming Irani chai, Osmania biscuits, and plates of bun maska at a small tapri near Abids, the idea took root — a clean writing app with heart.

Build a simple, distraction-free writing application that gives users a peaceful space to type their thoughts, automatically saves the content with session details, and ties everything securely to the user for later access — with the warm spirit of Telangana.
